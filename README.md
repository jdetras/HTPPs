# Web app for field phenotype prediction

## About the project
In this project, we developed an web-app that predicts the rice phenotypes from the field phenotye data using support vector regression(SVR), neural network, etc.

The users can select various model options for training their own dataset, e.g. learning rate, optimization algorithm, number of layers interactively.

The outputs from the training will be availble through csv format and tensorflow model output file.
The datasets are collected manually and from UAV images.
